<A NAME="intro"><H1>Introduction</H1></A>
<P>
The Propeller GCC Library is an implementation of the standard C
library. It attempts to conform to the C89 version of the standard,
with some C99 extensions. This documentation assumes that the user is
familiar with the C language and C libraries; we will focus on the
Propeller specific details of this library rather than general usage.
</P>

<A NAME="environment"><H1>Environment</H1></A>
<P>
  The <CODE>main</CODE> function has prototype:
<PRE>
  int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *environ[]); 
</PRE>
</P><P>
    <CODE>argv</CODE> are the arguments to the program; this is a NULL
    terminated list of pointers to strings. Conventionally the first
    argument (<CODE>argv[0]</CODE>) is the name of the program. Since
    the Propeller has no operating system, it is up to the application
    to supply arguments. This is done with the global variable
    <CODE>char *_argv[]</CODE>, which is passed directly to main as
    <CODE>argv</CODE>.
</P><P>
    <CODE>argc</CODE> is a count of the arguments to the program, and
    is initialized from <CODE>_argv</CODE> automatically by the
    startup code.
</P><P>
    <CODE>environ</CODE> is a list of environment variables, also NULL
    terminated. As with <CODE>argv</CODE>, this is initialized from a
    global variable, in this case <CODE>char *_environ[]</CODE>. The 
    <CODE>getenv</CODE> library function also
    uses <CODE>_environ</CODE> to look for variables.
</P><P>
    The strings in <CODE>_environ</CODE> should be of the form
    <CODE>VAR=value</CODE>, where "VAR" is the name of the environment
    variable and "value" is its value. At present <CODE>TZ</CODE> is
    the only environment variable that is actually used by the library
    (for the <A HREF="TimeZOnes">time zone</A>), but some applications
    may also look at the environment and require customized settings.
</P>

<A NAME="locales"><H1>Locales and Character Sets</H1></A>
<P>
The library starts up in a plain "C" locale which uses an 8 bit ASCII
character set. Only the 7 bit ASCII subset is
recognized by the character classification functions, but character
conversion to wide characters uses ISO 8859-1 (so a character
like <CODE>'\xa0'</CODE> converts to the wide
character <CODE>L'\u00a0'</CODE> when processed by <CODE>mbtowc</CODE>
or a similar function).
</P>
<P>
The library also provides a "C.UTF-8" locale which is the same as the
"C" locale except that the encoding is UTF-8 rather than ISO
8859-1. UTF-8 allows wide characters to be represented by multiple
bytes in a lossless way. Only the multibyte to/from wide character
conversion routines (including the ones inside functions such as
printf) are affected; character classification functions
like <CODE>isalpha</CODE> still only recognize the ASCII subset of Unicode.
</P>
<P>
To set the UTF-8 character encoding, do
<PRE>
  setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "C.UTF-8");
</PRE>
or just
<PRE>
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
</PRE>
in your <CODE>main</CODE> function. To switch back to ASCII, do
<PRE>
  setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "C");
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Note that the locale setting affects all threads in a program. Also,
the locale and multibyte/wide character functions are not available
in <CODE>-mcog</CODE> mode.
</P>

<A NAME="stdio"><H1>Stdio</H1></A>
<P>
The standard I/O library implementation ("stdio") is fairly
complete. Unlike in many other systems, stdio is fundamental; it is
not implemented on top of POSIX like functions such
as <CODE>open</CODE> and <CODE>close</CODE>. Rather, there is a
<A HREF="#drivers">driver layer</A> which implements the files that
<CODE>fopen</CODE> operates on.
</P>
<A NAME="FILE"><H2>FILE</H2></A>
<P>
The stdio FILE structure is in most respects fairly conventional. It
contains flags for how the file was opened, a pointer to a buffer, and
a buffer size. Unlike many libraries, the Propeller GCC library does
not automatically use <CODE>malloc</CODE> to allocate the FILE buffer;
rather it defaults to a small character array inside the FILE
structure. Some drivers (particularly for disks and similar devices)
may override this to provide a bigger buffer.
</P>
<P>
The FILE structure also contains an array of driver specific variables
(in <CODE>drvarray</CODE>) which drivers may use for any
purpose they wish. 
</P>

<A NAME="fopen"><H2>fopen</H2></A>
<P>
The <CODE>fopen</CODE> function
takes a string describing the device or file that is to be opened. In
the Propeller GCC library this string should start with a prefix which
specifies the <A HREF="#drivers">driver</A>, followed by a string
which is passed to the driver. The prefix should end with a colon. For
example, to open the simple serial port driver for reading and writing
at 9600 baud, with transmit pin 5 and receive pin 5, do:
<PRE>
  FILE *f = fopen("SSER:9600,5,5", "r+");
</PRE>
Here <CODE>"SSER:"</CODE> is the prefix for the simple serial device,
and <CODE>"9600,5,5"</CODE> are the parameters for the
device. Similarly, opening a file for writing on a DOS file system
might be achieved by something like:
<PRE>
  FILE *f = fopen("DOS:log.txt", "w");
</PRE>
</P>
<A NAME="fopen_driver"><H3>__fopen_driver</H3></A>
<P>
  The <CODE>__fopen_driver</CODE> function is like <CODE>fopen</CODE>,
  but has additional parameters directly specifying the handle and driver to
  use, rather than relying on a prefix. So for example:
<PRE>
  stdin = freopen(stdin, "SSER:9600,5,5", "r");
</PRE>
could also be called as:
<PRE>
  extern _Driver _SimpleSerialDriver;
  stdin = __fopen_driver(stdin, &_SimpleSerialDriver, "9600,5,5", "r");
</PRE>
<CODE>__fopen_driver</CODE> is used internally by <CODE>fopen</CODE>
and <CODE>freopen</CODE>, but may sometimes be useful to application
programmers who need direct control over driver and handle usage.
</P>

<A NAME="cooked"><H2>Raw vs. Cooked mode</H2></A>

<P>
Some drivers (notably the serial drivers) support a "cooked" mode of
input. In this mode characters are echoed when they are received, and
backspace (or delete) may be used to delete characters. Additionally,
input is gathered until either the requested number of characters is
received or a newline is seen.
</P><P>
Cooked mode is
selected by setting the <CODE>_IOCOOKED</CODE> bit in
a <CODE>FILE</CODE> structure's <CODE>_flag</CODE> field. If the bit
is clear, then "raw" mode is used, where there is no echoing and no
interpretation of special characters.
</P>
<P>
Cooked mode is the default. To read characters directly from stdin
without processing, do something like:
<PRE>
  stdin->_flag &= ~_IOCOOKED;
</PRE>
This also causes stdin to effectively be unbuffered, since the
terminal driver only processes 1 character at a time in raw mode.
</P>

<A NAME="nonblock"><H2>Non-blocking Reads</H2></A>
<P>
Terminal style drivers also support the ability to attempt to read a
byte and return immediately if none is available. This is accomplished
by setting the <CODE>_IONONBLOCK</CODE> bit in the <CODE>_flag</CODE>
field of the <CODE>FILE</CODE> structure. For example, to check to see
if a byte is available from stdin, you could do:
<PRE>
  stdin->_flag |= _IONONBLOCK;
  c = getchar();
</PRE>
If a character is available then <CODE>c</CODE> will be set
to that character, otherwise it will be set to <CODE>-1</CODE>. Note
that this is the same as <CODE>EOF</CODE>; in non-blocking mode there
is no way to distinguish between end of file and no character
currently available (for terminals there never is really an end of
file).
</P>

<A NAME="printf"><H2>Printf and Code Size</H2></A>
<P>
  The <CODE>printf</CODE> function (and related functions such
  as <CODE>sprintf</CODE>) can consume quite a bit of memory. To help
  reduce the footprint of these functions, the library provides
  several options:
  <UL>
    <LI><CODE>__simple_printf</CODE> is a simple version of printf with
      support for the most common output formats (hex and decimal
      integers, strings, and characters) but without support for
      floating point, 64 bit integers, right
      justification, precision, alternate output formats, and other
      advanced features. <CODE>__simple_printf</CODE> is also not
      thread safe, so it should be used only in single threaded
      applications. You can
      use this version of printf in your code by
      adding <CODE>-Dprintf=__simple_printf</CODE> to the command
      line. The simple printf is by far the smallest version of
      printf, but obviously it is limited.
    </LI>
    <LI>The default <CODE>printf</CODE> function supports all integer output
      formats and options, but leaves out floating point output
      (the <CODE>e</CODE>, <CODE>f</CODE>, and <CODE>g</CODE>
      formats). This is the one found in libc.
    </LI>
    <LI>The full version of <CODE>printf</CODE>, including floating
      point support, is found in the math library libm, which is
      selected by adding <CODE>-lm</CODE> to the command line of the
      final build step.
    </LI>
  </UL>
</P>

<A NAME="cogprintf"><H3>Printf in -mcog mode</H3></A>
<P>
  The stdio functions in -mcog mode are even simpler. Only the
  equivalent of <CODE>__simple_printf</CODE> is available in -mcog mode
  (there isn't enough room for more). Only the standard output is
  available in -mcog.
</P>

<A NAME="time"><H1>Time Related Functions</H1></A>
<P>
There is a normal set of time related functions in the library. The
defines for these are mostly in <CODE>&lt;time.h&gt;</CODE>.
</P>
<H2>Types</H2>
<H3>time_t</H3>
<P>
  The <CODE>time_t</CODE> type is used for keeping track of dates. As
  in POSIX, it
  contains the value <CODE>86400*(days since Jan. 1, 1970) + (seconds
  elapsed today)</CODE>, all in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
  time zone. This is not the same as seconds elapsed since
  Jan. 1, 1970, because leap seconds are ignored (as in POSIX).
</P>
<P>
  Note that unless there is a real time clock on the board (with an
  appropriate driver!) and the
  time zone has been set correctly, the values stored
  in <CODE>time_t</CODE> are almost certainly bogus and should not be
  relied on.
</P>
<H3>clock_t</H3>
<P>
  The <CODE>clock_t</CODE> type contains a count of processor
  cycles. It is a 32 bit type, and so on a typical 80MHz board it will
  roll over in about 54 seconds.
</P>

<A NAME="TimeZones"><H2>Time Zones</H2></A>
<P>
  Some functions (such as <CODE>localtime</CODE>
  or <CODE>strftime</CODE>) make use of time zone settings. The time
  zone is set automatically from the <CODE>TZ</CODE>
  <A HREF="#environment">environment variable</A>. This specifies the
  standard time name, offset from GMT, and (optionally) a daylight
  savings time name. For example, include <CODE>"TZ=EST5EDT"</CODE> as
  one of the strings in the <CODE>_environ</CODE> array for the US
  Eastern time zone.
</P><P>
  Only the North American daylight savings times rules are recognized
  at present, and only the current ones (as of 2011) are implemented.
</P>

<A NAME="RTC"><H2>Real Time Clocks</H2></A>
<P>
  The interface to real time clocks is via two function pointers:
  <PRE>
    #include &lt;sys/rtc.h&gt;
    int (*_rtc_gettime)(struct timeval *tv);
    int (*_rtc_settime)(const struct timeval *tv);
  </PRE>
  These point to functions to get and set the current time,
  respectively. The <CODE>struct timeval</CODE> structure is described
  by POSIX, and has two fields <CODE>tv_sec</CODE> (giving the current
  time in <CODE>time_t</CODE> format) and <CODE>tv_usec</CODE> (giving
  the microseconds elapsed since <CODE>tv_sec</CODE> last changed;
  during a leap second this might go up to 2000000000).
</P>
<P>
  There is a default clock that simply uses the built-in cycle
  counter. At a typical clock rate of 80MHz this counter overflows in
  54 seconds. The default RTC driver uses a 64 bit tick counter to
  compensate for this, but a time retrieval function (such as time())
  must be called more often than the counter overflows in order for it
  to keep the high word of the tick counter accurate.
</P>
<P>
  There is also a mechanism to use another cog to update the cycle
  counter, which will remove the requirement for frequent calling of
  the clock functions. To do this, call
  the <CODE>_rtc_start_timekeeping_cog()</CODE> routine, which will
  start a cog running whose entire purpose is to keep the clock
  up-to-date.
</P>
<P>
  Alternatively, if you have spare time on one of your cogs, you can
  kick the built-in cycle counter yourself (without the expensive call
  to the time() routine which performs several 64-bit math
  operations).  To do this, set the global variable
  <CODE>_default_ticks_updated</CODE> to a non-zero value, and call the
  _update_default_ticks() routine on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
  If you have an alternate way to keep time (such as a hardware chip
  like the DS1318), replace the built-in drivers by assigning the
  global <CODE>_rtc_gettime</CODE> and <CODE>_rtc_settime</CODE>
  pointers to your own gettime() and settime() routines.
</P>

<A NAME="drivers"><H1>Device Drivers</H1></A>
<P>
Drivers for the <A HREF="#stdio">standard I/O library</A> may be
written by the user and installed in the system. The library comes
with some default drivers, which are described below.
</P>

<A NAME="InstallDrivers"><H2>Installing Drivers</H2></A>
<P>
In the default configuration only the simple serial driver is
installed. This is easily modified by the program at compile time.
The global variable <CODE>_driverlist</CODE> is a NULL terminated
array of pointers to driver structures that should be included. So for
example to include both the simple serial driver and full duplex
serial driver, you would do:
<PRE>
#include &lt;driver.h&gt;
extern _Driver _SimpleSerialDriver;
extern _Driver _FullDuplexSerialDriver;

_Driver *_driverlist[] = {
  &_SimpleSerialDriver,
  &_FullDuplexSerialDriver,
  NULL
};
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The first driver in the list is the "default" driver, and is used to
open the <CODE>stdin</CODE>, <CODE>stdout</CODE>,
and <CODE>stderr</CODE> FILE descriptors. If you want finer control
over how these files are opened, you can either use
the <CODE>freopen</CODE> function on them at the start of your code,
or define a function <CODE>_InitIO</CODE> which will set up the file
handles.
</P>

<A NAME="DriversProvided"><H2>Drivers Provided in the Library</H2></A>
<A NAME="simpleserial"><H3>Simple Serial Driver (Prefix SSER:)</H3></A>
<P>
The simple serial port driver 
(<CODE>_Driver _SimpleSerialDriver</CODE>)
is a half duplex driver for generic
serial ports. It defaults to doing I/O at the rate specified in the
<CODE>_baud</CODE> variable (normally 115200 on most boards), with
transmit pin <CODE>_txpin</CODE> and receive pin <CODE>_rxpin</CODE>.
These defaults may be overridden by the string passed
to <CODE>fopen</CODE>. This string contains the baud rate, optionally
followed by a comma and the receive pin number and then another comma
and the transmit pin number, all in decimal notation. So for example
the default 
<PRE>
FILE *f=fopen("SSER:", "r");
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
FILE *f=fopen("SSER:115200,31,30", "r");
</PRE>
on most boards.
</P>
<P>
The simple serial driver does not require any additional cogs to
operate.
</P>
<P>
  Note that because the simple serial driver runs completely in the
  local cog, it shares the cog's DIRA and OUTA register with the
  calling code.  Therefore, avoid overwriting the DIRA/OUTA bits
  corresponding to the simple serial driver's TX and RX pins.  You can
  do this when setting or clearing bits for other I/O devices by using
  bit-setting and bit-masking instead of direct assignment
  (e.g. <CODE>DIRA |= 3</CODE> or <CODE>DIRA &= ~3</CODE> instead
  of <CODE>DIRA = 3</CODE> or <CODE>DIRA = 0</CODE>).  This is always
  a good idea, but failing to do this in any code that uses the simple
  serial driver will result in unpredictable I/O.
</P>
<H3>Full Duplex Serial Driver (Prefix FDS:)</H3>
<P>
The full duplex serial driver (<CODE>_Driver
_FullDuplexSerialDriver</CODE>) takes over a cog in order to provide
reliable full duplex communication on a serial line. A separate cog is
needed for every set of transmit and receive pins in use. Like
the <A HREF="#simpleserial">simple serial driver</A>, the full duplex
serial driver defaults to the values in the board
specific <CODE>_baud</CODE>, <CODE>_txpin</CODE>,
and <CODE>_rxpin</CODE> variables, and these may be overridden by
passing a string containing <I>baud</I>,<I>rxpin</I>,<I>txpin</I>.
</P>

<A NAME="WritingDrivers"><H2>Writing New Drivers</H2></A>
<P>
It is fairly straightforward to write a device driver. Drivers are
represented by a <CODE>_Driver</CODE> structure, as defined in
<CODE>&lt;driver.h&gt;</CODE>. This structure has the following
fields, which must be set up by the driver code:
<DL>
  <DT><CODE>const char *prefix</CODE></DT>
  <DD>The file prefix that tells <CODE>fopen</CODE> which driver to
    use; this should end in a colon <CODE>:</CODE></DD>
  <DT><CODE>int (*fopen)(FILE *fp, const char *name, const char *mode)</CODE></DT>
  <DD>A hook called by the <CODE>fopen</CODE>
    function. The <CODE>name</CODE> parameter contains the portion of
    the name passed to <CODE>fopen</CODE> that comes <I>after</I> the
    prefix. <CODE>fp</CODE> is the <CODE>FILE</CODE> structure that
    is being set up. The hook should put any driver specific
    variables that are required into the <CODE>drvarg</CODE> array
    in <CODE>fp</CODE>; if more than 4 longs are required, it should
    allocate memory and put a pointer
    into <CODE>drvarg</CODE>. The <CODE>fopen</CODE> hook should
    return 0 on success, and -1 on failure; in the latter case it
    should set <CODE>errno</CODE> to an appropriate value.</DD>
  <DT><CODE>int (*fclose)(FILE *fp)</CODE></DT>
  <DD>A hook called when a file is being closed; this should free any
    memory allocated by the <CODE>fopen</CODE> hook.</DD>
  <DT><CODE>int (*read)(FILE *fp, unsigned char *buf, int size)</CODE></DT>
  <DT><CODE>int (*write)(FILE *fp, unsigned char *buf, int size)</CODE></DT>
  <DD>These are the I/O functions, called to actually read and write
    data. Many drivers will have to implement their own versions of
    these hooks, but some may be able to use the default
    functions <CODE>_null_read</CODE> and <CODE>_null_write</CODE>
    (which return EOF and do nothing, respectively)
    or <CODE>_term_read</CODE> and <CODE>_term_write</CODE> (which do
    terminal I/O using the <CODE>getbyte</CODE>
    and <CODE>putbyte</CODE> hooks, see below).</DD>
  <DT><CODE>int (*seek)(FILE *fp, long offset, int whence)</CODE></DT>
  <DD>A hook called to change the current read or write position in the file.
    <CODE>whence</CODE> is one
    of <CODE>SEEK_SET</CODE>, <CODE>SEEK_CUR</CODE>,
    or <CODE>SEEK_END</CODE>, which have the same meanings as they do
    for the <CODE>fseek</CODE> function. A driver need not implement
    the <CODE>seek</CODE> hook; if this hook is set to NULL, then any
    attempt to seek on the file will fail and <CODE>errno</CODE> will
    be set to <CODE>ENOSEEK</CODE>.</DD>
  <DT><CODE>int (*remove)(const char *name)</CODE></DT>
  <DD>A hook called to remove a file. File removal is not yet
    implemented, so most drivers will simply set this to NULL.</DD>
  <DT><CODE>int (*getbyte)(FILE *fp)</CODE></DT>
  <DD>An optional hook for single character I/O; reads and returns a
    single character. This hook is used by
    the <CODE>_term_read</CODE> function for cooked terminal I/O; if a
    driver does not wish to use <CODE>_term_read</CODE> for its reader
    function, it may set this hook to NULL.</DD>
  <DT><CODE>int (*putbyte)(FILE *fp)</CODE></DT>
  <DD>An optional hook for single character I/O. This hook is used by
    the <CODE>_term_read</CODE> and <CODE>_term_write</CODE> functions
    for cooked terminal I/O; if a driver does not wish to
    use these functions, it may set
    this hook to NULL.</DD>
</DL>
</P>
<P>
  After the driver is written, it must also
  be <A HREF="#InstallDrivers">installed</A>.
</P>
<A NAME="CogModeDrivers"><H2>Cog mode drivers</H2></A>
<P>
  In <CODE>-mcog</CODE> mode the stdio driver facility is not
  available (it is too large to fit in the 2K of internal space in a
  cog). Instead, the stdio library for <CODE>-mcog</CODE> uses just
  two functions, <CODE>putchar</CODE> and <CODE>getchar</CODE>. The
  default <CODE>putchar</CODE> implementation writes characters to the
  serial port (using code very much like the simple serial driver).
</P>
<P>
  Note that <CODE>fopen</CODE> and similar functions are not supported
  in <CODE>-mcog</CODE> mode. Only <CODE>stdin</CODE>
  and <CODE>stdout</CODE> are supported.
</P>

<A NAME="Threads"><H1>Threads</H1></A>
<P>
Sometimes one wants to run some code on another cog. There are two
ways to do this: to run a copy of the LMM (or XMM) interpreter on the
other cog, or to run native cog code (compiled
with <CODE>-mcog</CODE>) on the other cog. Both of these amount to
running a thread on the other cog
</P>
<P>
There are also times when one wants to run more threads of execution
than there are cogs. The <B>pthreads</B> functions provide a way to do
this. Pthreads can run on other cogs or on the same cog.
</P>

<A NAME="RunningLMM"><H2>LMM on Another Cog</H2></A>
<P>
  Running compiled code in another thread is very straightforward
  in <CODE>-mlmm</CODE>, <CODE>-mcmm</CODE>, or <CODE>-mxmmc</CODE>
  modes. To start a new thread running function
  <CODE>foo</CODE> with argument <CODE>arg</CODE> do:
  <PRE>
    int cog = _start_cog_thread(sp, foo, arg, tls_ptr);
  </PRE>
  Here <CODE>sp</CODE> points to the top of the new thread's stack,
  and <CODE>tls_ptr</CODE> points to a new <CODE>_thread_state_t</CODE> to
  hold the thread local storage for this thread (that is, the library
  variables that need to be kept per-thread rather than globally; for
  example <CODE>errno</CODE>). The new cog id is returned
  in <CODE>cog</CODE>. If no cogs are available, -1 is returned.
</P>
<P>
  Note that <CODE>_start_cog_thread</CODE> is not recommended for use
  in XMM mode, because there is no data cache coherency mechanism;
  thus, any use of variables in external memory by more than one COG
  can lead to data corruption. In the other modes (LMM, CMM, and XMMC)
  the data is stored in hub memory and hence no external RAM cache is required.
</P>
<P>
  There are several synchronization methods available for code
  running on different cogs. The most basic is
  the <CODE>__lock/__unlock</CODE> mechanism provided
  in <CODE>sys/thread.h</CODE>. These locks are spin locks; a cog that
  is waiting on the lock loops until it becomes available. More
  sophisticated (blocking) lock mechanisms are available in
  the <A HREF="#Pthreads">pthreads</A> library.
</P>
<P>
  To use a spin lock, simply declare a variable as:
  <PRE>
    #include &lt;sys/thread.h&gt;
    _atomic_t mylock;
  </PRE>
  and then lock and unlock it like:
  <PRE>
    __lock(&amp;mylock);
    // .. do some things
    __unlock(&amp;mylock);
  </PRE>
  It is important to hold locks only for as long as required, and to
  unlock them immediately afterwards. Also, the locks are not
  recursive. If a thread attempts to lock a variable which it has
  already locked, it will hang.
</P>

<A NAME="Pthreads"><H2>Pthreads</H2></A>
<P>
  It is also possible to use the standard POSIX pthreads functions in
  <CODE>pthreads.h</CODE> to start and stop threads. pthreads will run
  on other cogs if available; if none are available then the threads
  will have to share cogs. The number of pthreads that can run
  simultaneously is limited only by memory.
</P>
<P>
  When a new pthread is started, the library attempts to start it on a
  new cog. If no new cog can be allocated, the library runs it on an
  existing cog. However, multiple threads on the same cog must
  cooperate; that is, a thread will keep running until it calls some
  blocking function (such as <CODE>sleep</CODE>) or
  calls <CODE>pthread_yield</CODE>. 
</P>
<P>
  To compile a program to use pthreads, link
  with <CODE>-lpthread</CODE>. The pthread functions themselves, and
  some slight modifications to standard functions to support pthreads,
  are in that library.

<P>
  To run some C code directly in a cog (not in LMM mode) we have to
  compile it with the <CODE>-mcog</CODE> flag. We also have to do some
  linker tricks to make sure that some definitions in the library and
  kernel do not conflict with definitions in the main LMM code.
</P>
<P>
  Typically we would put all the C code for a cog in one file, and
  compile it with a set of commands like:
  <PRE>
    propeller-elf-gcc -mcog -r -o mydriver.o -Os mydriver.c
    propeller-elf-objcopy --localize-text --rename .text=mydriver.cog mydriver.cog
  </PRE>
  The first line creates the cog program; the <CODE>-r</CODE> option
  tells gcc that we want it to be relocatable (we will be further
  linking it with the main LMM program).
  The second line causes all of the global text segment symbols
  (function definitions and such) to become local
  to the cog program so they will not interfere
  with similar symbols in the LMM program. It also renames the .text
  section (where the code is) to mydriver.cog. The linker knows that
  any section whose name begins or ends with <B>.cog</B> is an
  overlay intended to be run inside a cog.
</P>
<P>
  By convention COG programs are named <CODE>foo.cog</CODE>,
  but this is just a convention. The important thing to the linker is
  the name of the section containing the cog code, which must start or
  end with .cog. The linker also creates symbols telling where the code
  starts (and ends) in the file. For a section
  named <CODE>foo.cog</CODE>, it creates symbols
  <CODE>__load_start_foo_cog</CODE> and <CODE>__load_stop_foo_cog</CODE>
  (note that since period is not a valid character in a C identifier,
  it is translated to underscore if it is in the middle of a name and stripped if it is at the start of the name).
  Similarly for a section named <CODE>.cog.my.driver</CODE> it creates symbols
  <CODE>__load_start_cogmydriver</CODE> and <CODE>__load_stop_cogmydriver</CODE>.
  We can use these
  symbols to load the overlays into a cog. For example, to start the
  mydriver.cog code and pass it in a pointer to a mailbox, we would do:
  <PRE>
    #include &lt;propeller.h&gt;
    cognew(__load_start_mydriver_cog, &mailbox);
  </PRE>
