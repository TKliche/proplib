<A NAME="intro"><H1>Introduction</H1></A>
<P>
<I>This document is still a work in progress, and not all standards
  violations are necessarily listed herein!</I>
</P>
<P>
  The Propeller GCC compiler + library conforms to the C90 (ISO/IEC
  9899:1990) standard, as far we we know. Any failure to conform is a
  bug; please report it as such.

  The compiler and library mostly conform to the C99 standard (ISO/IEC
  9899:1999) except as noted in <A HREF="#exceptions">exceptions to the
    C99 standard</A>.
</P>

<A NAME="implementation"><H1>Implementation Defined Behavior</H1></A>
<P>
  Here are some of the implementation defined behaviors as specified in Annex
  J.3 of the C99 Standard. See also the GCC documentation for the
  general GCC implementation behaviors; here we document details that
  are specific to the Propeller implementation of GCC and to the
  default library.
</P>
<A NAME="environment"><H2>Environment</H2></A>
<P>
  The <CODE>argv</CODE> argument to <CODE>main</CODE> is derived from
  the global array <CODE>const char *__argv[]</CODE>, which is a NULL
  terminated list of strings. By default this contains only a single
  empty string followed by NULL.
</P>
<A NAME="characters"><H2>Characters</H2></A>
<P>
  There are 8 bits in a byte (3.6).
  <CODE>char</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>unsigned char</CODE> by
  default (6.2.5).
  We use UTF-8 encoding for multibyte characters at run time; however,
  note that the "C" locale does not support any operations on these
  characters. Use the "C.UTF-8" locale to operate with multibyte
  characters and wide characters.
</P>

<A NAME="exceptions"><H1>Exceptions to the C99 Standard</H1></A>
<P>
  Propeller GCC does not implement all of the features of C99. The
  exceptions are as follows.
</P>

<A NAME="compiler-exceptions"><H2>Compiler</H2></A>
<P>
  GCC does not implement some of the <CODE>#pragma</CODE> directives
  for floating point control mandated by the standard.
</P>

<A NAME="library-exceptions"><H2>Library</H2></A>
<P>
  The library is missing some features of the C99 standard. The
  missing features are outlined in this section.
</P>
<A NAME="stdio"><H3>Missing features in stdio functions</H3></A>
<P>
  The <CODE>printf</CODE> family of functions does not accept
  the <CODE>%a</CODE> and <CODE>%A</CODE> specifiers for output of
  hexadecimal floating point. Similarly, <CODE>scanf</CODE> does not
  accept those specifiers for input of floating point numbers in
  hexadecimal notation.
</P>
<P>
  To get floating point output from <CODE>printf</CODE> and related
  functions it is necessary to link with <CODE>-lm</CODE>. (This is
  not actually a standard violation, but it may be surprising.)
</P>
<P>
  <CODE>printf</CODE> and <CODE>scanf</CODE> do not correctly round
  floating point numbers in many cases.
</P>

<A NAME="stdlib"><H3>Missing features in stdlib functions</H3></A>
<P>
  <CODE>strtod</CODE> and <CODE>strtof</CODE> do not always round
  their outputs correctly according to the standard.
</P>

<A NAME="wide-char"><H3>Wide character I/O is not implemented</H3></A>
<P>
  The wide character input and output functions from &lt;wchar.h&gt;, such
  as <CODE>fgetwc</CODE>, <CODE>fputwc</CODE>, <CODE>wprintf</CODE>,
  and <CODE>wscanf</CODE>, are not implemented.
</P>
